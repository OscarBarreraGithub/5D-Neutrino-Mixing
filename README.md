# Constraining a Warped 5th Dimension

This repository explores the constraints on warped five-dimensional Randall-Sundrum models.

[`neutrinos`](neutrinos)
- Computes neutrino mass spectra, the PMNS matrix, and allowed parameter ranges under experimental constraints.

[`diagonalization`](diagonalization)
- Implements mass matrix diagonalization routines supporting both singular value decomposition (SVD) and Takagi factorization.

[`warpConfig`](warpConfig)
- Provides utilities to compute derived 5D warp parameters and the fermion zero-mode overlap
functions used throughout the project.
