# Constraining a Warped 5th Dimension

This repository explores the constraints on warped five-dimensional Randall-Sundrum models.

[`neutrinoMass`](neutrinoMass)
- Computes neutrino mass spectra and allowed parameter ranges under cosmological
	sum-of-masses constraints.

[`diagonalization`](diagonalization)
- Implements mass matrix diagonalization routines supporting both
	singular value decomposition (SVD) and Takagi factorization.
