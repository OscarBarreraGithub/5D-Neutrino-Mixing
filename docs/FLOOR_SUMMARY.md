# Minimal-RS Floor Summary (canonical current state)

**Status:** authoritative. Post-audit (June 2026). This is the one-page,
up-to-date summary of the minimal (non-custodial) Randall–Sundrum quark-sector
KK-scale floor. Where any older doc disagrees, this file and
[`reports/collaborator_2026-06/CONTENT.md`](../reports/collaborator_2026-06/CONTENT.md)
win.

All scales below are the **physical first gauge-KK mass** `M_KK = x₁·Λ_IR`
with `x₁ ≈ 2.4487`. Do not confuse with the geometric `Λ_IR ≡ 1/z_v`.

## The floor

The `epsilon_K` floor is **LANE-DEPENDENT** — there are THREE distinct flavor-model
lanes with different floors, and they must never be blended (canonical definitions:
[`docs/MODEL_CONVENTIONS.md`](MODEL_CONVENTIONS.md)). Every floor below is tagged
with its lane; "lane-independent" floors carry no Yukawa freedom and are the same
across all three.

| Constraint | Floor (physical M_KK) | Lane | Type | Tunable? | Driver |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `epsilon_K` (K001) | **~30 TeV** (median) / ~10 TeV (paper-era 95%q) | **A — anarchic reproduction** (literature strawman, NOT our model) | typical (median anarchic) | **yes** — align Im M12 → 0 | flavor / CP |
| `epsilon_K` (K001) | **~6.3–7 TeV** | **B — production AS RUN** (simplified fit-aligned MFV, no V5KM — what we actually run) | sharp wall, near-unique fitted locus | (V5KM alignment not yet wired) | flavor / CP |
| `epsilon_K` (K001) | **~2 TeV** | **C — FPR ideal** (full V5KM alignment, not yet in production) | literature target | **yes** — V5KM alignment | flavor / CP |
| oblique S,T,U (EW001) | **~18–20 TeV** | lane-independent | **existence** (best-tuned) | **no** — no Yukawa freedom | RS T-problem |
| Z→bb (T010/T011) | **~5 TeV** | lane-independent | — | no (gauge-dominated; c_Q3 pinned by m_t) | EW |
| Δm_s (B003), Δm_d, Δm_K, D⁰ | few TeV → <~1 TeV | A (anarchic) | tunable | yes | flavor |
| collider KK searches (CR*) | ~4 TeV | lane-independent | subleading | — | direct search |

**The epsilon_K lane gap.** Production AS RUN (~7 TeV) is **NEITHER** the anarchic
wall (~10–30 TeV) **NOR** the FPR ~2 TeV ideal; the 7→2 TeV gap is exactly the
principled alignment (FPR V5KM, or Bauer-S2-style RH-down U(3) degeneracy) not yet
wired into the production path.

Two distinct notions of "floor":

- **Typical (median anarchic) floor ≈ 30 TeV** (**LANE A — anarchic, the
  literature strawman, NOT our model**), set by `epsilon_K`. This is where a
  *median* anarchic point survives. It is **tunable**: aligning the down-sector
  so Im M12 → 0 drives the NP contribution to zero, so the *existence* floor for
  any single flavor constraint is ≲1 TeV. Note: what we **actually run** in
  production (**LANE B**) sits at **~7 TeV** (a sharp fitted wall), and the **FPR
  ideal** (**LANE C**, V5KM aligned) is **~2 TeV** — do not quote the ~30 TeV
  anarchic number as "our floor".
- **Existence (fine-tuned, irreducible) floor ≈ 18–20 TeV**, set by oblique
  **S,T,U** (the RS T-parameter problem). This carries **no Yukawa freedom**, so
  min ≈ median (spread only ~1.5×): even maximally fine-tuned Yukawas cannot put
  minimal RS below ~18–20 TeV. This is precisely the motivation for custodial RS.

**Z→bb is NOT the driver.** The old claim of a "25–30 TeV Z→bb-dominated floor"
(and "108 TeV at 1σ") was a **B1** bug (see below); corrected, Z→bb collapses to
~5 TeV and is gauge-dominated.

## Custodial caveat

Custodial RS (`SU(2)_L × SU(2)_R × U(1)_X × P_LR`) **fixes the oblique T
problem** and protects Zb_L, but does **not** relax `epsilon_K` (a flavor/CP
constraint). The custodial scan's strict floor is ~2–3 TeV from rigorous ΔF=2
and ~7 TeV inclusive once proxy EW/collider failures are counted — but
`epsilon_K` tunability, not Z→bb, is what governs the residual flavor floor.

## Audit fixes (June 2026, all dual-reviewed)

Six implementation errors found by an adversarial audit, now fixed:

- **B1** (blocker): Z→bb fermion-KK admixture mistranslated from Casagrande
  0807.4937 — wrong sign and ~190× too large. This faked the 25–30 TeV Z→bb
  floor. After the fix (+ residual-B1, the `1−2c → 1+2c` flavour-sum
  denominator sign), Z→bb is gauge-dominated at ~5 TeV.
- **B2**: `epsilon_K` SVD→PDG rephasing. Independently re-verified **CORRECT** —
  pinning V_ts as the 5th rephasing anchor is a harmless gauge choice; `epsilon_K`
  and all Δm observables are exactly rephasing-invariant (bit-identical numeric
  check). See the gauge note in `quarkConstraints/fit.py:_rephase_to_pdg_convention`.
- **B3**: ΔF=2 O4/O5 chiral coefficients + meson-state normalization.
- **M1**: Z→bb (T010) gate.
- **M2**: EW001 ΔT convention — oblique T was ~6× too weak. Correct minimal form
  is `ΔT_minimal = x₁² · (πL)/(2 cos²θ_W) · v²/M_KK²` (physical-M_KK convention).
- **M5**: a tagging bug (plural "proxies" missed by substring match).

## Validated literature reproductions

These reproductions are **LANE A (anarchic)** — the baseline used to validate the
code against the published literature, **NOT** the production / our model (LANE B,
the fit-aligned MFV at ~7 TeV). Run the fixed code in **anarchic-forward** mode
(draw complex O(1) Yukawas, forward-compute, keep mass+CKM-reproducing points):

- **Bauer 0912.1625**: `epsilon_K` 95%-quantile floor ≈ 10 TeV (paper-era
  inputs); ~106× Im/Re(M12) "ε_K problem" (≈ Bauer's ~100×). Script:
  `scripts/anarchic_bauer_s1.py` (+ `scripts/run_bauer_s1_deband.sbatch`,
  `scripts/run_bauer_scenarios.sbatch`).
- **Gedalia, Grossman, Nir, Perez 0906.1879**: D⁰ funnel containment rising to
  ~88% at 10 TeV. Script: `scripts/anarchic_complex_m12.py`.
- **Blanke 0809.1073**: Re/Im(M12) for K and B_s. Scripts:
  `scripts/anarchic_complex_m12.py`, `scripts/anarchic_reproduction_extract.py`.

The production scan **fits** Yukawas to masses+CKM (a thin locus), whereas the
literature **scatters** anarchic Yukawas (a fat ~6-decade cloud); the two
methods give very different spreads, which matters when comparing floors.
