# Phase-2 Program Ledger — RS-EW rigor + full-catalog scan readiness

Durable state for the post-rebuild program. Survives orchestrator context resets.
**On resume/compaction, read this FIRST, then `rs_ew_sector_design.md` and `NEEDS_HUMAN_PHYSICS.md`.**
The constraint rebuild (103 constraints) is COMPLETE (see `REBUILD_LEDGER.md`). This program
makes the catalog's NEW-PHYSICS rigorous (close the G1/G2 proxy gap) so a definitive 100M+
cluster scan is meaningful, plus the items the triage marked "we build, not human input".

## ⛔ GOVERNANCE — the dual-signoff gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE, user mandate 2026-06-02)

The orchestrator (Claude main loop) makes **NO design decisions and writes NO production code**.
It only routes work, records verdicts, and maintains this ledger. EVERY work item — plan AND
implementation — must be independently approved by **BOTH a codex agent AND a Claude/Opus agent**.
Nothing is committed without dual APPROVE.

Per work item:
1. **PLAN** — a codex (gpt-5.x xhigh) authors an implementation plan, grounded in the approved design.
2. **PLAN REVIEW (dual)** — a *second* codex independently critiques it **and** an Opus agent independently
   critiques it. Route critiques back to the plan author; iterate until **both a codex and Opus APPROVE the plan**.
3. **IMPLEMENT** — codex implements per the approved plan (code + tests).
4. **IMPLEMENT REVIEW (dual)** — codex code/physics review **and** Opus independent review (re-derive numbers,
   check scaffold contract / isolation / honesty / determinism). Route fixes; iterate until **both APPROVE**.
5. **COMMIT** — one commit per item. Message records: plan approvers (codex+opus SHAs/verdicts), impl approvers,
   what changed. Update this ledger + push.
6. Orchestrator never overrides an agent verdict with its own opinion. Disagreements → another review round.

**Retroactive review (R-items):** anything committed since the rebuild began that did NOT get dual (codex+Claude)
review gets it now — codex review + Opus review of the existing code/doc; both APPROVE → mark "retro-OK"; any
finding → fix gate. Scope: from the rebuild start; includes a "similar implementation plan from last week" to be located.

Codex via `~/bin/codex_worker.sh` (CODEX_MAX_CONCURRENCY=6, own background task, never chained-heredoc).
Build prompts under `.orchestration/runs/<ITEM>/`. Keep orchestrator context lean: delegate all reading; read terse verdicts only.

## Scope split (from NEEDS_HUMAN_PHYSICS triage)
- **IN SCOPE (we build, dual-gated):** G1 RS-EW couplings, G2 lepton couplings, G4 CKM phase (B002/B004),
  exclusive form factors (B013/B014 from literature), re-wire affected constraints proxy→rigorous, full-catalog harness + smoke scan.
- **OUT (genuine human input — stays advisory/non-vetoing, surfaced for the user):** EDM rigor (E001/E004/E006–E009),
  ε′/ε (K003) + charm/nonleptonic CPV (C003/B032–B034) SM adoption, collider σ×BR recast scope (CR*). DO NOT fake these.

## Work items
| ID | Item | Plan (codex+opus) | Impl review (codex+opus) | Committed |
|----|------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| W1 | G1 design — opus∥codex drafts → consensus → dual-review (codex caught contact-formula BLOCKER: dropped light-Z g_q^SM·δg_l^LFV) → revise → **RE-REVIEW DUAL APPROVE** (codex DESIGN-OK + Opus DESIGN-OK). `rs_ew_sector_design_CONSENSUS.md` is the implementation-ready spec; 7 phases; 24→26 FULL/17 PARTIAL/7 HUMAN. | dual ✅ | n/a (design) | `4e5eff0` |

| W2-P2 | Spectrum+overlap kernel `rs_ew_spectrum.py` — dual gate: codex caught a KK-TOWER root-extraction BLOCKER Opus missed (n6=21.3 vs physical 18.1, n9→n10 regression) → fixed (ordered bracketed scan) → both independently recomputed tower+a(c) → **DUAL APPROVE** (1645 passed) | dual ✅ | dual ✅ | `389de37` |
| W2-P3 | Quark NC: point_builder extension + quark Z-matrices/contacts + rewire Z-pole/FCNC-Z/rare-B-K-charm vector — PLAN IN FLIGHT (plan-first; then dual-review plan → implement → dual-review) | plan in flight | — | — |

| R1 | Scaffold hardening `02e2424`→`f82036a` — retro-review found 3 framework gaps (NaN/Inf accepted; load_anchor couldn't validate value_id/block_key/units/CL; mutably-shared extras). Fixed: finite/bool/Severity guards, optional anchor validators, immutable extras, reset_for_tests, TEMPLATE. **RETRO-OK + HARDENED** ✅ (dual: codex SCAFFOLD-FIX-OK + Opus SCAFFOLD-FIX-OK; 1054→1061 passed, backward-compat verified) | dual ✅ | dual ✅ | `f82036a` |
| R2 | ΔF=2 adapter running-wrappers `fd2f46a` — Opus-only | — | — | — |

## ⏯️ CURRENT STATE / NEXT ACTION (updated 2026-06-02)
- Governance gate active and working (it caught a real defect at EVERY stage: 3 scaffold blockers, design LFV cross-term, P1 KK-root limit error, P2 KK-tower bug — several flagged by codex after Opus had OK'd).
- DONE (dual-approved + committed): **W1** design `4e5eff0`; **W2-P1** derivation `ffb4ad2`; **W2-P2** kernel `389de37`; **R1** scaffold hardened `f82036a`; **R4** mu_e retro-OK.
- IN FLIGHT: **W2-P3** quark-NC PLAN (`b32iwdxhj`, plan-first) — when it lands: dual-review the plan (codex+opus) → implement sub-steps (3a builder+quark-Z/contacts; 3b Z-pole; 3c FCNC-Z; 3d rare B/K/charm) → dual-review each → commit.
- NEXT after P3: W2-P4 lepton NC → P5 charged-current → P6 fermion-KK/Higgs (24→26) → P7 loops (mostly human-deferred). Then retro R2/R3/R5/R7 (R8 low-stakes). Then W4 CKM phase, W5 form factors, W6 full-catalog harness + smoke scan → 100M.
- HUMAN-INPUT items still open (surfaced, NOT decided): custodial/BKT model choice; dipole-loop normalization; EDM basis/CP/matrix-elements; ε′/ε & charm/nonleptonic CPV SM adoption; collider σ×BR recast scope.
- Concurrency: codex ≤6 via wrapper; launch each as OWN background task (never chained-heredoc). Watch for orphan codex after agent-spawned codex (kill wrappers before children). NOTE row "W2" (generic) is superseded by W2-P1..P7.
