# Needs Human Physics — structured list of flagged gaps

Running list of items where a constraint's implementation could NOT be fully
grounded in established physics with the inputs currently available, and uses a
documented proxy / placeholder pending human review. Each constraint is
self-contained (one isolated class), so these gaps do NOT break other
constraints — they are contained to the listed constraint's `evaluate()` and
recorded in its docstring + result diagnostics.

Maintained per-constraint as the rebuild proceeds; presented as the final
deliverable. See `.orchestration/runs/<ID>/` for the full agent trail of each.

## ★ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — what needs human physics input (read this first)

The rebuild is COMPLETE: **103 constraints (95 PRIMARY + 8 SECONDARY), full suite 1054 passed, 0 registry import failures.** Every constraint computes a rigorous, validated SM (or SM≈0 for forbidden processes) side and a defensible experimental budget. The human-input items below are confined to the **new-physics (RS) matching** and a handful of **incalculable-SM observables** — they are documented proxies, never fabricated numbers, and each is flagged in the constraint's docstring + result `diagnostics["needs_human_physics"]`. Of 103 constraints, **98 carry a proxy caveat; 5 are fully rigorous end-to-end** (K001 ε_K, K002 Δm_K, B001 Δm_d, B003 Δm_s, C001 D⁰ mixing — the ΔF=2 sector, because the KK-gluon coupling IS on `ParameterPoint`).

The gaps cluster into **6 categories**:

**G1 — Cross-cutting RS electroweak-coupling matching (the dominant gap; ~majority of the 98).**
`ParameterPoint` exposes quark mass-basis couplings + the KK-gluon mass, but NOT the full RS EW sector (KK W/Z masses & profiles, Z-fermion coupling shifts, Z′ couplings, lepton/neutrino bulk profiles). So every EW-mediated NP contribution (rare semileptonic K/D/B decays, b→sνν, b→sℓℓ, Z-pole, dipoles) uses a documented coupling proxy for the **NP part only** (SM part is rigorous). *Decision needed:* build the shared RS-EW coupling machinery + extend `point_builder`/`ParameterPoint` (unlocks rigorous NP for ~all of these at once), or accept the bounded proxies. Affects: most of beauty, kaon, charm, top_higgs_ew rare/Z families.

**G2 — Lepton-flavor-violating / off-diagonal lepton couplings not on `ParameterPoint`.**
All LFV constraints supply the off-diagonal charged-lepton coupling as an explicit proxy: L001/L002/L005/L006/L008/L009/L010 (μ→eγ, μ→3e, μ–e conv, muonium, τ→eγ, τ→3μ, …), K019/K020/K021 (K→(π)eμ), Z→eμ/eτ/μτ LFV (T015–T017), Higgs LFV (T018–T020). *Decision needed:* RS lepton-sector flavor structure on `ParameterPoint`.

**G3 — Collider σ×BR / recast gap (all of collider_rs, CR001–CR014).**
Mass-vs-published-limit recasts use a single-number mass proxy; the full σ×BR, branching surface, width dependence, production mix, interference, and detector-acceptance/limit-curve recast are flagged. *Decision needed:* proper signal recasts (or accept mass-proxy bounds).

**G4 — CKM-phase machinery absent in the core.**
B002 (S_ψKs / sin2β) and B004 (φ_s) take the SM reference phase from the catalog yaml — no core CKM-phase computation exists. *Decision needed:* add CKM-phase machinery, then derive these in-core.

**G5 — Incalculable-/dirty-SM honest stubs (INFO/SOFT, NON-VETOING) — dual NEEDS-HUMAN (SM side AND RS side).**
These intentionally do not veto; they record the catalogued bound + flag both the missing SM calculation and the RS matching: **K003** (ε′/ε), **K013** (radiative kaon), **B032/B033/B034** (nonleptonic / φ_s^sss), **C003** (charm direct CPV), **E004/E006/E007/E008/E009** (EDMs: atomic/hadronic CP-odd matrix elements + Weinberg 3-gluon), **CR011** (needs full recast). Plus charged-current/G_F-matching pulls **EW002** (CKM 1st-row unitarity), **EW003** (|Vcb|/|Vub|), **K018** (|Vus| K_l3). *Decision needed:* genuine SM hadronic/ChPT/lattice inputs (ε′/ε, EDM matrix elements) or RS charged-current matching.

**G6 — EDM CP-odd loop machinery + exclusive form factors / exclusive-SM predictions.**
E001 (e-EDM) needs a genuine RS one-loop CP-odd dipole; E004–E009 need hadronic CP-odd matrix elements (overlaps G5). Exclusive radiative B013 (Bs→φγ) and B014 (B→ργ/ωγ) need real exclusive form factors, photon-helicity observables (A_Δ/S_φγ), and a genuine exclusive-SM theory BR prediction (none in catalog → their HARD budgets are honest *measurement-consistency* bands, not theory-vs-data room).

**Bottom line / highest-leverage action:** building the shared **RS electroweak-coupling sector** on `ParameterPoint`/`point_builder` (G1) would convert the single largest block of proxies into rigorous NP in one move, and G2 is the lepton-sector extension of the same work. G4 (CKM phase) is a small, self-contained core addition. G5/G6 are genuinely hard SM-theory inputs (lattice/ChPT/loop) best sourced from the literature per observable. None of these block the catalog from running or affect the 5 fully-rigorous ΔF=2 anchors or any constraint's SM side.

The per-constraint detail (with validated SM numbers, budgets, and exact proxy descriptions) follows below, wave by wave.

## Cross-cutting infrastructure gap (affects many EW/rare/LFV constraints)

**RS electroweak coupling inputs are not on `ParameterPoint`.** The scaffold's
`ParameterPoint` currently exposes quark mass-basis couplings + KK gluon mass.
Rigorous RS *new-physics* matching for electroweak-mediated processes (rare
semileptonic/neutrino decays, LFV, Z-pole, EDMs) needs the full RS EW sector:
KK W/Z masses & profiles, Z-fermion coupling shifts, Z′ couplings, and lepton/
neutrino bulk profiles. Until `point_builder` is extended to produce these,
such constraints implement a rigorous **SM** part + a **documented proxy** for
the RS-NP part.
**Human decision needed:** build the shared RS-EW coupling machinery +
extend `ParameterPoint`/`point_builder` (enables rigorous NP for these
families), or accept bounded proxies. (Independent of per-constraint correctness.)

## Per-constraint flags

### K004 — BR(K⁺→π⁺νν̄)   [status: committed @ 4ff15a3]
- **Rigorous:** SM short-distance BR (Buras/BGS parametrization; validated
  BR_SM ≈ 8.50×10⁻¹¹ vs literature ≈ 8.6×10⁻¹¹).
- **Proxy / needs human input:** RS NP contribution uses a Z-like effective
  coupling proxy `X_NP=(Δ_sd^L+Δ_sd^R)·Δ_ν/(g²M_KK²)`. The full RS electroweak
  KK/Z/Z′ tower + neutrino-coupling matching is not available on
  `ParameterPoint` (see cross-cutting gap above).
- **Trail:** `.orchestration/runs/K004/`.

### K005 — BR(K_L→π⁰νν̄)   [status: committed @ ed736c3]
- **Rigorous:** SM short-distance BR (purely CP-violating top term; validated 2.95×10⁻¹¹).
- **Proxy / needs human input:** RS NP = same Z-like proxy as K004 (Im part); full RS-EW matching absent (cross-cutting gap).
- **Trail:** `.orchestration/runs/K005/`.

### B002 — S_ψKs / sin2β   [status: committed @ 80d4224]
- **Rigorous:** NP mixing-phase shift from the existing running ΔF=2 complex M₁₂.
- **Needs human input:** the SM reference phase 2β is taken from B002.yaml (β=22.63°) — no CKM-phase
  computation exists in the core. Substitute a core-derived 2β when CKM-phase machinery is added.
- **Trail:** `.orchestration/runs/B002/`.

### C002 — CP violation in neutral charm mixing   [status: committed @ b85f482]
- **Rigorous:** NP CP amplitude |Im(M₁₂^NP)| from running ΔF=2 D⁰ mixing; budget from HFLAV φ_M interval.
- **Needs human input:** no grounded SM long-distance charm phase / Γ₁₂; CP-phase verdict omits SM-side
  long-distance contribution (charm is theoretically dirty).
- **Trail:** `.orchestration/runs/C002/`.

### B004 — φ_s (B_s→J/ψφ)   [committed @ 6034c96]
- **Needs human input:** SM φ_s = −2β_s taken from B004.yaml — no CKM-phase computation in the core.

### EW002 — CKM first-row unitarity   [committed @ d640d2e]
- **Needs human input:** RS charged-current / G_F matching not on ParameterPoint; only the SM-vs-data tension is rigorous (NP shift = 0).

### EW003 — |V_cb|/|V_ub| incl-vs-excl   [committed @ 4947894]
- **Needs human input:** charged-current EW/WET RS matching absent; rigorous part is the data/theory pull only.

### L001 — μ→eγ   [committed @ 99063a2]
- **Needs human input:** lepton-sector RS dipole couplings not on the quark-only ParameterPoint → dipole coefficient is a documented proxy; missing-input case returns explicitly `evaluated=False` (not a pass).

### B005 / B011 / B022 — B-meson rare decays   [committed be82e38 / f746d56 / e4c64d2]
- **Rigorous:** SM rates validated (B_s→μμ 3.65e-9; B→X_sγ 3.40e-4 with LL RG running; B⁺→K⁺νν̄ 5.58e-6 with correct long-distance split).
- **Needs human input:** RS NP is a documented proxy in each shared module
  (`rare_b_dilepton` C9/C10 penguin, `bsgamma` C7/C8 dipole, `rare_b_nunu` Z-like) —
  full b→s EW-penguin/dipole RS matching needs EW KK couplings not on ParameterPoint (cross-cutting gap).
- These shared modules are reused by the downstream fan-out (B006/B012/B015-B019/B021/B023); the NP-proxy caveat propagates to all of them.

### Wave-6 family pioneers (K006, C004, T010, T001, B016)   [committed df0eb34/cf65c4b/f8ad10d/72a22e4/3cafb41]

- **Needs human input (NP proxies, all from the cross-cutting EW-coupling gap):**
  `rare_kaon_dilepton` s→dℓℓ Z/penguin; `rare_charm_dilepton` c→uℓℓ; `zpole` Zbb-coupling-shift (classic RS Z→bb);
  `top_fcnc` top-Z FCNC coupling; exclusive `rare_b_dilepton` C9/C10 (B016 budget carries a 30% proxy-theory inflation).
  These propagate to all downstream consumers of each module.

### Wave-7 (K008, C005, T012, T002, B015)   [committed — see git log]

- **Needs human input:** RS NP proxies inherited from the shared modules (s→dℓℓ y7V/y7A, c→uℓℓ, Zcc-shift, top-Z FCNC, C9/C10) — all the cross-cutting EW-coupling gap.

### Wave-8 (K009, C007, T015, T003, B017)   [committed — see git log]
- **Rigorous:** K_L→π0μμ y7V/y7A SM; B→K(*)ℓℓ R_K proxy SM=1; t→cγ pure-NP; Z→eμ LFV pure-NP; D⁺→π⁺μμ SD.

  top-photon dipole, C9/C10) — cross-cutting EW-coupling gap. C007 is a FULL-q² proxy (resonance/LD windows
  not applied) + 8.96% form-factor normalization uncertainty.

### Wave-9 (K010, C006, T004, T016, B018)   [committed — see git log]
- RS NP proxies inherited from shared modules (s→dℓℓ K_S a_S w/ sign-envelope, c→uℓℓ LFV eμ coupling,
  top-photon dipole t→uγ, off-diagonal Z-eτ LFV, lepton-non-universal C9/C10 for R_K) — cross-cutting EW-coupling gap.

### Wave-11 pioneers (B009, K018, CR001, E001, L002)   [committed — see git log]
- **Rigorous:** B⁺→τν tree SM 8.63e-5; |V_us| K_l3 extraction + unitarity pull; KK-gluon mass vs tt̄ limit; e-EDM SM≈0; μ→3e dipole(L001)+contact+interference.
- **Needs human input:** charged-current RS proxy (B009); CR σ×BR recast proxy (CR001); RS one-loop CP-odd dipole for EDMs (E001 — real loop machinery); μ→3e Z/box + dipole-contact relative PHASE (L002 uses conservative constructive envelope); K018 RS CKM shift ~0.
